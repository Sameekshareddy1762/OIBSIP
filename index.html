<h2>About Anandi Gopal Joshi</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3> 
</p>
Originally named Yamuna, Joshi was born, raised in a Marathi Chitpavan Brahmin family.
As was the practice at that time and due to pressure from her mother, she was married at the age of nine to Gopalrao Joshi, a widower almost twenty years her senior.
After marriage, Yamuna's husband renamed her 'Anandi'.
At the age of fourteen, Anandibai gave birth to a boy, but the child lived only for a total of ten days due to lack of medical care.
This proved to be a turning point in Anandi's life and inspired her to become a physician.

<h3>In the Unites States</h3>
<p>
Anandibai travelled to New York from Kolkata (Calcutta) by ship, chaperoned by two female English missionary acquaintances of the Thorborns.
In New York, Theodicia Carpenter received her in June 1883. Anandibai wrote to the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, asking to be admitted to their medical program,[12] which was the second women's medical program in the world
Anandibai began her medical training at age 19. In America, her health worsened because of the cold weather and unfamiliar diet. She contracted tuberculosis
she graduated with an MD in March 1886; the topic of her thesis was "Obstetrics among the Aryan Hindus.
The thesis utilized references from both Ayurvedic texts and American medical textbooks.[9] On her graduation, Queen Victoria sent her a congratulatory message.[7][13]

<h3>Return to India</h3>
<p>
    In late 1886, Anandibai returned to India, receiving a grand welcome.[14] The princely state of Kolhapur appointed her as the physician-in-charge of the female ward of the local Albert Edward Hospital.

<h3>Death</h3>
<p>
    Anandibai died of tuberculosis early the next year on 26 February 1887 before turning 22 in Pune.
    Years preceding her death, she was fatigued and felt constant weaknesses. Medicine was sent to her from America but there were no results so she kept studying medicine until death.
    Her death was mourned throughout India. Her ashes were sent to Theodicia Carpenter, who placed them in her family cemetery at the Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery in Poughkeepsie, New York. 
    The inscription states that Anandi Joshi was a Hindu Brahmin girl, the first Indian woman to receive education abroad and to obtain a medical degree.
